== Use Version Catalogs to Centralize Dependency Versions

Use Version Catalogs provide a centralized, declarative way to manage dependency versions throughout a build.

=== Explanation

When you define your dependency versions in a single, shared version catalog, you reduce duplication and make upgrades easier.
Instead of changing dozens of `build.gradle(.kts)` files, you update the version in one place.
This simplifies maintenance, improves consistency, and reduces the risk of accidental version drift between modules.
Consistent version declarations across projects also make it easier to reason about behavior during testing—especially in modular builds where transitive upgrades can silently change runtime behavior in later stages of the build.

However, version catalogs only influence declared versions, not resolved versions.
Use them in combination with <<dependency_locking.adoc#sec:dependency-locking,dependency locking>> and <<resolution_rules.adoc#using-resolution-rules,version alignment>> to enforce consistency across builds.
To influence resolved versions, check out <<platforms.adoc#platforms,platforms>>.

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

Avoid declaring versions in `project.ext`, constants, or local variables:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useVersionCatalogs/kotlin",files="gradle/libs.versions.toml[]"]
====

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useVersionCatalogs/kotlin/do-this",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=do-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useVersionCatalogs/groovy/do-this",files="build.gradle[tags=do-this]"]
====

Avoid misusing version catalogs for unrelated concerns:

* Don’t use them to store shared strings or non-library constants
* Don’t overload them with arbitrary logic or plugin-specific configuration

==== Do This Instead

Use a centralized `libs.versions.toml` file in your `gradle/` directory:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useVersionCatalogs/kotlin/avoid-this",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useVersionCatalogs/groovy/avoid-this",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]

[[name_version_catalog_entries]]
== Name Version Catalog Entries Appropriately

Consistent and descriptive names in your version catalog enhance readability and maintainability across your build scripts.

=== Explanation

Version catalogs provide a centralized way to manage dependencies.
Adopting clear naming conventions for catalog entries ensures that developers can easily identify and use dependencies throughout the project.

The following guidelines help in naming catalog entries effectively:

1. **Use dashes to separate segments**: Prefer dashes (`-`) over underscores (`_`) to separate different parts of the entry name.
+
*Example*: For `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api`, use `log4j-api`

2. **Derive the first segment from the project group**: Use a unique identifier from the project's group ID as the first segment.
+
*Example*: For `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`, use `jackson-databind`

3. **Omit redundant segments**: If the group and artifact IDs are the same, avoid repeating them.
+
*Example*: For `io.ktor:ktor-client-core`, use `ktor-client-core`, not `ktor-ktor-client-core`

4. **Convert internal dashes to camelCase**: If the artifact ID contains dashes, convert them to camelCase for better readability in code.
+
*Example*: `spring-boot-starter-web` becomes `springBootStarterWeb`

5. **Avoid implicit terms**: Exclude terms that are obvious or implied in the context of your project.
+
*Example*: For `com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core`, use `aws-core`, not `aws-javaSdkCore`

6. **Suffix plugin libraries with `-plugin`**: When referencing a plugin as a library (not in the `[plugins]` section), append `-plugin` to the name.
+
*Example*: For `org.owasp:dependency-check-gradle`, use `dependency-check-plugin`
