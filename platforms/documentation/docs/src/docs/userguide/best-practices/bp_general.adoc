== Apply Plugins Using the `plugins` Block

You should always use the `plugins` block to <<plugin_basics.adoc#applying_plugins,apply plugins>> in your build scripts.

=== Explanation

The `plugins` block is the preferred way to apply plugins in Gradle.
The plugins API allows Gradle to better manage the loading of plugins and it is both more concise and less error-prone than adding dependencies to the buildscript's classpath explicitly in order to use the `apply` method.

It allows Gradle to optimize the loading and reuse of plugin classes and helps inform tools about the potential properties and values in extensions the plugins will add to the build script.
It is constrained to be idempotent (produce the same result every time) and side effect-free (safe for Gradle to execute at any time).

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock/kotlin/avoid-this",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock/groovy/avoid-this",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]
====

<1> *Declare a Repository*: To use the legacy plugin application syntax, you need to explicitly tell Gradle where to find a plugin.
<2> *Declare a Plugin Dependency*: To use the legacy plugin application syntax with third-party plugins, you need to explicitly tell Gradle the full coordinates of the plugin.
<3> *Apply a Core Plugin*: This is very similar using either method.
<4> *Apply a Third-Party Plugin*: The syntax is the same as for core Gradle plugins, but the version is not present at the point of application in your buildscript.

==== Do This Instead

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock/kotlin/do-this",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=do-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock/groovy/do-this",files="build.gradle[tags=do-this]"]
====

<1> *Apply a Core Plugin*: This is very similar using either method.
<2> *Apply a Third-Party Plugin*: You specify the version using method chaining in the `plugins` block itself.

== Do Not Use Internal APIs

Do not use APIs from a package where any segment of the package is `internal`, or types that have `Internal` or `Impl` as a suffix in the name.

=== Explanation

Using internal APIs is inherently risky and can cause significant problems during upgrades.
Gradle and many plugins (such as Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin Gradle Plugin) treat these internal APIs as subject to unannounced breaking changes during any new Gradle release, even during minor releases.
There have been numerous cases where even highly experienced plugin developers have been bitten by their usage of such APIs leading to unexpected breakages for their users.

If you require specific functionality that is missing, itâ€™s best to submit a feature request.
As a temporary workaround consider copying the necessary code into your own codebase and extending a Gradle public type with your own custom implementation using the copied code.

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]
====

<1> Casting to `AttributeContainerInternal` and using `toMap()` should be avoided as it relies on an internal API.

==== Do This Instead

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=do-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=do-this]"]
====

<2> Implementing your own version of `toMap()` that only uses public APIs is a lot more robust.
